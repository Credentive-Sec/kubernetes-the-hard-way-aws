# Assumptions about this guide

This guide makes several assumptions about you, the reader.

1. We assume that you are interested in learning, so we spend extra time discussing the details of what we are doing and why.
2. We assume that you have some experience with the command line, and especially the Unix command line. Our examples will use Unix/Linux/MacOS shell commands. For Windows, consider using WSL2.
